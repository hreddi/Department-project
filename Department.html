    <br>
    <div class="center-text">
        With nearly 80 full-time faculty members, the CS Department at Mason is the largest department in the College of Engineering
         and Computing, one of the largest departments on campus, and the largest, fastest growing, and highest ranked Computer Science 
         department in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The department has a world-class faculty with research strengths in all areas of computing, and a strong commitment to teaching.  Nearly half of our faculty were recruited in the past three years, and we now rank among the Top 40 Computer Science Departments in the US.  Our faculty are engaged in leading edge research in their respective fields and have authored widely used textbooks and software. Our faculty's excellence is reflected in the awards we have received for our research (27 NSF CAREER and AFOSR Young Investigator awards, 7 Mason Emerging Researcher awards) and teaching (8 Mason Excellence in Teaching awards), and our faculty include three ACM Fellows and five IEEE Fellows.
        <br>
        <br>
        The department offers two Bachelor of Science programs  with a total enrollment of over 2200 students:  the B.S. in Computer Science and the inter-disciplinary B.S. in Applied Computer Science; four M.S. programs in Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Security and Assurance, and Software Engineering with a total enrollment of almost 1000 students; and a Ph.D. program in Computer Science with nearly 200 students. The department's faculty also teach and participate in the inter-disciplinary M.S. in Data Analytics Engineering and the Ph.D. in Information Technology offered by the Volgenau School of Engineering.Several members of the faculty are actively engaged in inter-disciplinary research collaborations with colleagues from all over campus and other universities. Indeed inter-disciplinary collaboration in research and education is a key component of our departmental vision and strategic direction for the future.
